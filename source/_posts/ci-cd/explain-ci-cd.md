## Question

Explain the CI/CD pipeline.

## Answer

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery or Deployment) is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. This helps detect errors quickly and locate them more easily.

Key components of CI:
- Source code management (Git, SVN)
- Build automation tools (Maven, Gradle, npm)
- Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests)
- CI servers (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI)

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery is an extension of continuous integration. It ensures that code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. With continuous delivery, every code change is built, tested, and then pushed to a non-production testing or staging environment. This makes the actual deployment a manual decision.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers without human intervention. It's essentially an extension of continuous delivery with automated deployment to production.

### Benefits of CI/CD

1. **Faster time to market** - Automates the steps to deliver code to production
2. **Better quality code** - Automated testing helps catch bugs early
3. **Reduced risk** - Smaller, incremental changes are less risky
4. **Customer satisfaction** - Faster delivery of features and fixes
5. **Developer productivity** - Automation reduces manual tasks
6. **Reliable releases** - Standardized deployment process

### CI/CD Pipeline Stages

1. **Source**: Developers commit code to a version control system
2. **Build**: Code is compiled and built
3. **Test**: Automated tests are run (unit, integration, etc.)
4. **Deploy to Staging**: Application is deployed to a staging environment
5. **Acceptance Testing**: Manual or automated UAT
6. **Deploy to Production**: Application is deployed to production
7. **Monitoring**: Production application is monitored for issues
