## Question

What is Terraform and what problem does it solve?

## Answer

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. It solves several key problems:

1. **Manual infrastructure management**: Terraform replaces manual processes with code to provision and manage infrastructure.
2. **Configuration drift**: By managing infrastructure through code, Terraform helps prevent configuration drift between environments.
3. **Complexity**: Terraform manages both low-level components (compute, storage, networking) and high-level components (DNS entries, SaaS features).
4. **Provider diversity**: It works across multiple cloud providers and services through its provider ecosystem.
5. **Collaboration challenges**: Terraform enables teams to collaborate on infrastructure using version control.

## Question

What is the Terraform workflow?

## Answer

The core Terraform workflow consists of three stages:

1. **Write**: Define infrastructure as code using Terraform's declarative configuration language (HCL). This infrastructure can span multiple cloud providers and services.

2. **Plan**: Before making any changes, Terraform creates an execution plan that shows what will happen when you apply your code. This is done with the `terraform plan` command.

3. **Apply**: Once you've confirmed the plan looks correct, you use `terraform apply` to provision the defined infrastructure. Terraform tracks the real infrastructure in a state file which it uses to determine and implement the required changes.

This workflow can be expanded to include:
- `terraform init`: Initializes a working directory containing configuration files
- `terraform validate`: Validates the configuration files syntax
- `terraform destroy`: Destroys all resources managed by the current Terraform configuration

## Question

What is Terraform state and why is it important?

## Answer

Terraform state is a JSON file that maps real-world resources to your configuration, tracks metadata, and improves performance for large infrastructures. It's critically important for several reasons:

1. **Resource mapping**: State maintains a map between your Terraform configuration and the real-world resources it represents.

2. **Metadata tracking**: It stores metadata like resource dependencies that Terraform uses during operations.

3. **Performance**: For large infrastructures, state helps Terraform sync efficiently by tracking resources rather than rediscovering them.

4. **Collaboration**: When stored remotely (such as in HCP Terraform), state allows teams to safely collaborate on infrastructure.

5. **Change detection**: Terraform uses state to determine what changed in your configuration to create precise execution plans.

Without state, Terraform would be unable to know which resources it manages and would attempt to recreate resources that already exist, leading to errors and duplication.

## Question

How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?

## Answer

Terraform handles dependencies between resources in several ways:

1. **Implicit dependencies**: Terraform automatically creates implicit dependencies when one resource references another resource's attributes using interpolation syntax. For example, if an EC2 instance references a security group's ID, Terraform knows to create the security group before the EC2 instance.

2. **Explicit dependencies**: You can use the `depends_on` argument to explicitly define dependencies that Terraform can't infer automatically. This is useful for hidden dependencies that aren't apparent from the configuration.

3. **Resource graph**: Terraform builds a resource graph that shows the relationships between resources. It uses this graph to determine which resources can be created, modified, or destroyed in parallel to improve efficiency.

4. **Module dependencies**: When using modules, dependencies can exist between resources in different modules. Terraform handles these dependencies correctly through the same mechanisms.

This dependency management ensures that resources are created and destroyed in the proper order, avoiding issues like trying to attach a volume to an instance that doesn't exist yet.

## Question

What is a Terraform module and why would you use one?

## Answer

A Terraform module is a collection of standard configuration files in a dedicated directory. Modules are used to encapsulate and reuse resource configurations.

Key aspects of Terraform modules:

1. **Reusability**: Modules allow you to reuse configurations instead of writing similar code multiple times.

2. **Abstraction**: They abstract complex infrastructure into manageable, logical components.

3. **Consistency**: Modules provide a standardized way to deploy common infrastructure patterns.

4. **Composition**: You can combine modules to create complex infrastructures from simple building blocks.

5. **Versioning**: Modules can be versioned to ensure consistent deployments.

6. **Sharing**: Modules can be shared via the Terraform Registry or private registries.

You would use modules when:
- You need to deploy the same infrastructure in multiple places
- You want to enforce best practices and standards across teams
- You need to simplify complex infrastructure into manageable components
- You want to share common patterns within your organization

## Question

How does Terraform handle secrets and sensitive data?

## Answer

Terraform provides several mechanisms for handling secrets and sensitive data:

1. **Sensitive variables**: You can mark input variables as sensitive using the `sensitive = true` attribute. This prevents Terraform from showing their values in plans and outputs.

2. **Sensitive outputs**: Similar to input variables, outputs can be marked as sensitive to prevent their values from being displayed in the CLI output.

3. **Environment variables**: Secrets can be passed as environment variables using the `TF_VAR_` prefix, avoiding their inclusion in your code.

4. **External secret stores**: Terraform can integrate with external secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to retrieve secrets dynamically.

5. **State encryption**: For remote state backends that support it, state can be encrypted at rest to protect sensitive data stored in state.

6. **Resource-specific methods**: Some providers offer resource-specific methods for handling secrets, such as encrypted attributes or separate resources for secret management.

Best practices include:
- Never committing secrets to version control
- Using remote state with encryption
- Restricting access to Terraform state files
- Using least-privilege credentials for Terraform operations

## Question

What is the difference between Terraform and other IaC tools like Ansible, CloudFormation, or Pulumi?

## Answer

Terraform differs from other IaC tools in several key ways:

**Terraform vs. Ansible:**
- Terraform is primarily declarative (defining the end state), while Ansible is procedural (defining steps)
- Terraform focuses on infrastructure provisioning, while Ansible excels at configuration management and application deployment
- Terraform has strong state management, while Ansible is stateless by default
- Terraform is cloud-agnostic with a consistent workflow across providers; Ansible uses different modules for different providers

**Terraform vs. CloudFormation:**
- Terraform works across multiple cloud providers, while CloudFormation is AWS-specific
- Terraform has a more concise and human-readable syntax compared to CloudFormation's JSON/YAML
- Terraform offers a more predictable change workflow with explicit plan/apply stages
- CloudFormation has deeper AWS integration and benefits from AWS support

**Terraform vs. Pulumi:**
- Terraform uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), while Pulumi uses general-purpose programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.)
- Pulumi offers traditional programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and functions built into the language
- Terraform has a larger community and ecosystem due to being established earlier
- Both offer state management and multi-cloud support, but with different approaches

The choice between these tools often depends on specific requirements, existing skills, and infrastructure needs.

## Question

What are the key components of a Terraform configuration?

## Answer

A Terraform configuration consists of several key components:

1. **Provider blocks**: Define which providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) Terraform will use to provision resources. They include authentication and configuration details.

   ```hcl
   provider "aws" {
     region = "us-west-2"
   }
   ```

2. **Resource blocks**: Define infrastructure objects to be managed, like virtual networks, compute instances, or DNS records.

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "web" {
     ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

3. **Data sources**: Allow Terraform to use information defined outside your configuration, like reading existing resource properties.

   ```hcl
   data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
     most_recent = true
     filter {
       name   = "name"
       values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Variables**: Define parameters for your configuration to make it more flexible and reusable.

   ```hcl
   variable "instance_type" {
     description = "EC2 instance type"
     type        = string
     default     = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

5. **Outputs**: Return values from your resources, which can be useful for providing information or for use in other configurations.

   ```hcl
   output "instance_ip_addr" {
     value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
   }
   ```

6. **Modules**: Reusable configurations that group resources together.

   ```hcl
   module "vpc" {
     source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
     version = "3.14.0"
     
     name = "my-vpc"
     cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
   }
   ```

7. **Locals**: Named values calculated from expressions within a module.

   ```hcl
   locals {
     common_tags = {
       Environment = var.environment
       Project     = var.project_name
     }
   }
   ```

8. **Backend configuration**: Defines where and how the state file is stored.

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "s3" {
       bucket = "terraform-state-bucket"
       key    = "terraform.tfstate"
       region = "us-east-1"
     }
   }
   ```

## Question

What are Terraform workspaces and when would you use them?

## Answer

Terraform workspaces are separate instances of state data that can be used from the same working directory. Each workspace allows you to manage a distinct set of infrastructure resources using the same Terraform configuration files.

Key aspects of workspaces:

1. **State isolation**: Each workspace has its own state file, allowing you to manage multiple environments with the same configuration.

2. **Command integration**: You use commands like `terraform workspace new`, `terraform workspace select`, and `terraform workspace list` to manage workspaces.

3. **Current workspace reference**: You can reference the current workspace in your configuration using `${terraform.workspace}`.

You would use workspaces when:

- **Testing changes**: You want to experiment with changes without affecting your production infrastructure.
  
- **Environment management**: Managing development, staging, and production environments that have similar configurations but different resource instances.
  
- **Feature branches**: Supporting multiple short-lived feature branches that need their own infrastructure.

- **Multi-tenant deployments**: Deploying the same infrastructure for different tenants or clients.

Example usage in configuration:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? 10 : 1
  
  # Use workspace name in resource naming
  tags = {
    Name = "instance-${terraform.workspace}"
    Environment = terraform.workspace
  }
}
```

For more complex environment management, separate configuration files or directory structures might be more appropriate than workspaces.
