A data set is full of dimensions by which you measure the data.</p><h1 id="data-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-model"><span>Data Model</span></a></h1><p>In Splunk, a data model is a collection of data sets. The Pivot tool is powered by data models. Knowledge managers create data models so that data analysts can easily consume the data and use the Pivot tool to create reports and visualizations. This allows data analysts and business users to create powerful visualizations without needing to know SPL or the inner workings of Splunk.</p><ul><li>Make machine data easier to use</li><li>Simplify complex data through abstraction</li><li>Group specific types of data</li><li>Mathematical equations can be said to be data models</li><li>Data Models are Stacks of datasets</li><li>Datasets are stacks of knowledge objects</li><li>Knowledge objects include: Saved searches, field extractions, tags, and more</li></ul><p>Data models are hierarchical. They start with either a root event(far more popular) or root search. You can also have a root transaction, but one of the other two roots have to exist first. These roots have constraints. At the root level, constraints should be broad. In fact, roots are required to have and index-level constraint.</p><ul><li><strong>Events</strong> - Most commonly used. <em>Event constraints</em> - Must include an index constraint (<code>index=</code>)</li><li><strong>Searches</strong> - Spunk saved searches that include transforming commands, etc. <em>Search constraints</em> - Constrained to the full search string (Must include an index constraint (<code>index=</code>))</li><li><strong>Transactions</strong> - Combine multiple events from one or many sources into a single event. <em>Transaction constraints</em> - must be legally formed transaction search</li></ul><p>Fields and Data Models:</p><ul><li>Can be added to roots and children</li><li>Children inherit all fields from their parent <ul><li>Auto extracted - Splunk automatically discovered fields</li><li>Eval - A field generated as a result of an eval expression</li><li>Lookup - Fields that are the result of a lookup</li><li>Regular expression - Fields extracted by regex</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="data-visualization-context" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-visualization-context"><span>Data Visualization Context</span></a></h1><ul><li><p>Understand your audience</p><ul><li>Executives usually have different needs than individual contributors</li><li>Publicly available dashboards might display different data than internal-only reports and dashboards</li></ul></li><li><p>Understand your own goals</p><ul><li>What is the message for which you are using this visualization?</li><li>Like the famous &quot;author&#39;s purpose&quot; consider the PIE: do you want to persuade, inform, or entertain or a combination of all 3?</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="types-of-visualizations-in-splunk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-visualizations-in-splunk"><span>Types of Visualizations in Splunk</span></a></h1><p>Here are just a few of Splunk&#39;s chart types.

Great for comparing things across time</li><li>Single value - When you have a number to communicate, use a single value.</li><li>Gauge - Show an aggregated metric compared to a range</li><li>Table / Heatmap</li></ul><h1 id="reporting-and-alerting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reporting-and-alerting"><span>Reporting and Alerting</span></a></h1><p>Reports and alerts are knowledge objects in Splunk.

Triggered when the results of a search meet a specific condition that you define.
