It acquires the raw data stream from its source, breaks it into 64K blocks, and annotates each block with some metadata keys. The keys apply to the entire input source overall. They include the host, source, and source type of the data. The keys can also include values that are used internally, such as the character encoding of the data stream, and values that control later processing of the data, such as the index into which the events should be stored.</p><p>During this phase, Splunk software does not look at the contents of the data stream, so the keys apply to the entire source, not to individual events. In fact, at this point, Splunk software has no notion of individual events at all, only of a stream of data with certain global properties.</p><h2 id="parsing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#parsing"><span>Parsing</span></a></h2><p>During the parsing segment, Splunk software examines, analyzes, and transforms the data. This is also known as event processing. It is during this phase that Splunk software breaks the data stream into individual events.The parsing phase has many sub-phases:</p><ul><li>Breaking the stream of data into individual lines.</li><li>Identifying, parsing, and setting timestamps.</li><li>Annotating individual events with metadata copied from the source-wide keys.</li><li>Transforming event data and metadata according to regex transform rules.</li></ul><h2 id="indexing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#indexing"><span>Indexing</span></a></h2><p>During indexing, Splunk software takes the parsed events and writes them to the index on disk. It writes both compressed raw data and the corresponding index files into the buckets.</p><p>For brevity, parsing and indexing are often referred together as the indexing process. At a high level, that makes sense. But when you need to examine the actual processing of data more closely or decide how to allocate your components, it can be important to consider the two segments individually.</p><h2 id="search" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#search"><span>Search</span></a></h2><p>The search segment manages all aspects of how the user accesses, views, and uses the indexed data. As part of the search function, Splunk software stores user-created knowledge objects, such as reports, event types, dashboards, alerts, and field extractions. The search function also manages the search process itself.</p><h1 id="general-input-categories" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#general-input-categories"><span>General Input Categories</span></a></h1><ul><li>Data lakes: Unstructured or semi-structured</li><li>Databases: Structured</li><li>Message queues: Scripted and API inputs</li><li>SaaS and PaaS: HubSpot, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack/Teams, Workday, etc.</li><li>IaaS: AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI(Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)</li><li>File and directory inputs <ul><li>Monitor files and directories: Locally and remotely, Monitor compressed files(Compressed files are uncompressed before they are ingested into Splunk)</li><li>Upload: Upload files to Splunk, used for one-time analysis</li><li>MonitorNoHandle: Available for Windows hosts only, Monitos files and directories that the system rotates automatically</li></ul></li><li>Network inputs: Data from TCP and UDP(not recommended because no guarantee it will actually get to Splunk)</li><li>For syslog, best practice is to use Splunk Connector for Syslog.
