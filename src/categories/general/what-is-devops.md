## Question

What is DevOps?

## Answer

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 

DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology. It emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other IT professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.

Key principles of DevOps include:

1. **Automation** - Automating repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce errors
2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** - Frequent merging of code changes and automated deployment
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** - Managing infrastructure through code rather than manual processes
4. **Monitoring and Logging** - Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure
5. **Communication and Collaboration** - Breaking down silos between development and operations teams
6. **Microservices Architecture** - Building applications as a collection of small, loosely coupled services
